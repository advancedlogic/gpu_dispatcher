# Multi-Endpoint Support Requirements

## Introduction

This feature adds support for connecting to multiple GPU statistics servers instead of just one. This allows the GPU Worker Pool client to manage GPUs across multiple machines, significantly increasing the available GPU pool and providing better fault tolerance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multiple Endpoint Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure multiple GPU server endpoints so that I can utilize GPUs from multiple machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I configure multiple endpoints THEN the client SHALL connect to all available endpoints
2. WHEN an endpoint is unreachable THEN the client SHALL continue operating with remaining endpoints
3. WHEN I provide endpoints via environment variable THEN the client SHALL parse comma-separated URLs
4. WHEN I provide endpoints via constructor THEN the client SHALL accept a list of endpoint URLs
5. IF no endpoints are configured THEN the client SHALL fall back to single endpoint behavior

### Requirement 2: Global GPU ID Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want unique GPU identifiers across all endpoints so that I can distinguish between GPUs on different machines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple endpoints have overlapping GPU IDs THEN the system SHALL create unique global identifiers
2. WHEN a GPU is assigned THEN the assignment SHALL include both endpoint and local GPU ID information
3. WHEN displaying GPU information THEN the system SHALL show the source endpoint for each GPU
4. WHEN releasing a GPU THEN the system SHALL route the release to the correct endpoint

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Load Balancing

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the client to intelligently distribute GPU requests across endpoints so that I can achieve optimal resource utilization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting a GPU THEN the system SHALL prefer endpoints with more available GPUs
2. WHEN multiple endpoints have equal availability THEN the system SHALL use round-robin distribution
3. WHEN an endpoint becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL redistribute load to remaining endpoints
4. WHEN an endpoint recovers THEN the system SHALL gradually reintroduce it to the load balancing pool

### Requirement 4: Fault Tolerance and Failover

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle endpoint failures gracefully so that my application continues working even when some GPU servers are down.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an endpoint fails during operation THEN the system SHALL continue with remaining endpoints
2. WHEN all endpoints fail THEN the system SHALL queue requests until endpoints recover
3. WHEN a failed endpoint recovers THEN the system SHALL automatically reconnect and resume using it
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff for reconnection attempts

### Requirement 5: Unified Pool Status and Metrics

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see aggregated statistics across all endpoints so that I can monitor the entire GPU pool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN getting pool status THEN the system SHALL aggregate statistics from all endpoints
2. WHEN an endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL exclude it from current statistics but show it in endpoint health
3. WHEN getting detailed metrics THEN the system SHALL provide per-endpoint breakdown as well as totals
4. WHEN monitoring the system THEN the system SHALL provide endpoint health status and connectivity information

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an existing user, I want my current single-endpoint configuration to continue working without changes so that I can upgrade seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using existing single endpoint configuration THEN the system SHALL work exactly as before
2. WHEN migrating to multi-endpoint configuration THEN existing environment variables SHALL remain valid
3. WHEN using the existing API THEN all current methods SHALL work without modification
4. WHEN upgrading the library THEN existing code SHALL require no changes for single-endpoint usage

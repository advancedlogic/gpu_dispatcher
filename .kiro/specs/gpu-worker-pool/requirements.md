# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a GPU worker pool client that intelligently manages worker connections to GPUs based on real-time resource utilization metrics. The system will monitor GPU memory usage and utilization percentages, automatically allocating workers to available GPUs while respecting configurable thresholds. Workers will be blocked when all GPUs are exhausted or when resource thresholds are exceeded, ensuring optimal resource utilization and preventing GPU overload.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure GPU resource thresholds through environment variables, so that I can control when workers should be blocked based on memory and utilization limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read memory usage threshold from environment variable GPU_MEMORY_THRESHOLD_PERCENT
2. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL read utilization threshold from environment variable GPU_UTILIZATION_THRESHOLD_PERCENT
3. IF GPU_MEMORY_THRESHOLD_PERCENT is not set THEN the system SHALL use a default value of 80%
4. IF GPU_UTILIZATION_THRESHOLD_PERCENT is not set THEN the system SHALL use a default value of 90%
5. WHEN environment variables are invalid THEN the system SHALL log an error and use default values

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the client to periodically fetch GPU statistics from the /summary endpoint, so that worker allocation decisions are based on current resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL establish a connection to the GPU statistics service
2. WHEN polling is active THEN the system SHALL fetch GPU statistics every 5 seconds by default
3. WHEN the /summary endpoint is unreachable THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
4. WHEN GPU statistics are received THEN the system SHALL parse and validate the JSON response
5. IF the response format is invalid THEN the system SHALL log an error and continue with previous data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a worker process, I want to be assigned to an available GPU that meets resource thresholds, so that I can execute tasks without causing resource exhaustion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker requests GPU assignment THEN the system SHALL evaluate all available GPUs
2. WHEN evaluating GPUs THEN the system SHALL check memory_usage_percent against the configured threshold
3. WHEN evaluating GPUs THEN the system SHALL check utilization_percent against the configured threshold
4. IF a GPU meets both thresholds THEN the system SHALL assign the worker to that GPU
5. IF multiple GPUs are available THEN the system SHALL assign to the GPU with lowest combined resource usage
6. WHEN a worker is assigned THEN the system SHALL track the assignment and update internal state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a worker process, I want to be blocked when no GPUs are available or all GPUs exceed thresholds, so that I don't cause system overload by attempting to use exhausted resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no GPUs meet the resource thresholds THEN workers SHALL be blocked until resources become available
2. WHEN all GPUs are assigned to other workers THEN new workers SHALL be blocked in a queue
3. WHEN a worker is blocked THEN the system SHALL log the blocking reason and timestamp
4. WHEN GPU resources become available THEN the system SHALL unblock the longest-waiting worker
5. WHEN a worker is unblocked THEN the system SHALL immediately assign it to an available GPU

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want to monitor worker pool status and GPU assignments, so that I can understand system performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL maintain metrics on active workers per GPU
2. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL track the number of blocked workers
3. WHEN worker assignments change THEN the system SHALL log assignment and release events
4. WHEN requested THEN the system SHALL provide current pool status including GPU assignments
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information with context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a worker process, I want to be properly released from GPU assignment when my task completes, so that the GPU becomes available for other workers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a worker completes its task THEN it SHALL notify the pool of its completion
2. WHEN a worker is released THEN the system SHALL remove it from GPU assignment tracking
3. WHEN a worker is released THEN the system SHALL immediately check for blocked workers to unblock
4. IF blocked workers exist THEN the system SHALL assign the next worker in queue to the released GPU
5. WHEN worker release fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt cleanup
